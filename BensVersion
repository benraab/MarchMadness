We are looking at 10 Ivy League games. 
```{r}
ivy_games
sum(ivy_games$Upset)
mean(ivy_games$PointDiff)
table(ivy_games$Underdog_Seed)
nrow(ivy_games[ivy_games$PointDiff >= -9, ])
nrow(ivy_games[ivy_games$PointDiff >= -3, ])
```
In those games, the league has:
* 4 wins
* an average point differential of -3.8
* 8 single digit or better games (lose by 9 or less / win)
* 6 one possession or better games (loss by 3 or less / win)

We want to see how often that could occur by chance for teams of the same seeds. Over this time, the Ivy League representative has been a 12 seed four times, a 14 seed three times, and a 13, 15, and 16 once each. 

So what would happen if we took random samplings from those same seeds. How often could they win 40% of their games and keep the same close point differential.
```{r}
wins <- rep(0, 100000)
point_diff <- rep(0, 100000)
single_digit_games <- rep(0, 100000)
one_possession_games <- rep(0, 100000)

fake_df <- data.frame(wins, point_diff, single_digit_games, one_possession_games)

for (i in 1:100000){
  sample_data <- c(sample(fives$PointDiff, 4), 
                sample(fours$PointDiff, 1),
                sample(threes$PointDiff, 3),
                sample(twos$PointDiff, 1),
                sample(ones$PointDiff, 1))
  
  sample_wins <- 0
  
  for (j in 1:length(sample_data)){
    if (sample_data[j] > 0){
      sample_wins <- sample_wins + 1
    }
  }
  
  sample_single_digit_games <- 0
  for (k in 1:length(sample_data)){
    if (sample_data[k] >= -9){
      sample_single_digit_games <- sample_single_digit_games + 1
    }
  }
  
  sample_one_possession_games <- 0
  for (m in 1:length(sample_data)){
    if (sample_data[m] >= -3){
      sample_one_possession_games <- sample_one_possession_games + 1
    }
  }    
  
  fake_df[i, "wins"] <- sample_wins
  fake_df[i, "point_diff"] <- mean(sample_data)
  fake_df[i, "single_digit_games"] <- sample_single_digit_games
  fake_df[i, "one_possession_games"] <- sample_one_possession_games
}
```


After running 100,000 samples, we can see how many times a random sample of the same 10 seeds achieved the same metrics as the Ivy League.

```{r}

hist(fake_df$wins, 
     main = "Histogram of bootstrapped sample wins, N = 100,000",
     xlab = "Sample Wins",
     breaks = 9,
     xlim = c(0, 10),
     col = "lightblue")
abline(v = 3.5, lwd = 3, col = "navy")
legend("topright", "Ivy Wins", lwd = 3, col = "navy")

hist(fake_df$point_diff,
     main = "Histogram of bootstrapped sample point differentials, N = 100,000",
     xlab = "Sample Point Differential",
     col = "lightblue")
abline(v = -3.8, lwd = 3, col = "navy")
legend("topright", "Ivy Point Differential", lwd = 3, col = "navy")

hist(fake_df$single_digit_games,
     main = "Histogram of bootstrapped sample single-digit games, N = 100,000",
     xlab = "Sample Single Digit Games",
     breaks = 10,
     col = "lightblue")
abline(v = 7.5, lwd = 3, col = "navy")
legend("topright", "Ivy Single Digit Games", lwd = 3, col = "navy")

hist(fake_df$one_possession_games,
     main = "Histogram of bootstrapped sample one-possession games, N = 100,000",
     xlab = "Sample One Possession Games",
     breaks = 10,
     col = "lightblue")
abline(v = 5.5, lwd = 3, col = "navy")
legend("topright", "Ivy Single Digit Games", lwd = 3, col = "navy")
```

While those graphs are helpful, the numbers are also quite illuminating. The table below shows the Ivy value, the average sample value, and the likelihood of achieving the Ivy numbers or better by chance in our sample data.

```{r}
Categories <- c("Wins", "Point Differential", "Single Digit Games", "One-Possession Games")

Ivy_Value <- c(4, -3.8, 8, 6)

Sample_Average <- c(round(mean(fake_df$wins), 2), round(mean(fake_df$point_diff), 2),
                    round(mean(fake_df$single_digit_games), 2),
                    round(mean(fake_df$one_possession_games), 2))

Sample_Likelihood <- c(paste0(round(nrow(fake_df[fake_df$wins >= 4, ]) / 1000, 2), "%"),
                       paste0(round(nrow(fake_df[fake_df$point_diff >= -3.8, ]) / 1000, 2), "%"),
                       paste0(round(nrow(fake_df[fake_df$single_digit_games >= 8, ]) / 1000, 2), "%"),
                       paste0(round(nrow(fake_df[fake_df$one_possession_games >= 6, ]) / 1000, 2), "%"))

comparisons <- data.frame(Categories, Ivy_Value, Sample_Average, Sample_Likelihood)
comparisons
```



```{r}

paste0("The odds of winning at least four games and keeping a point differential less than -3.8 and playing a total of 8+ close games are ",
